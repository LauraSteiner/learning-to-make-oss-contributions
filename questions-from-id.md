# Questions on Open Source

This is my area for general questions and thoughts around open source.

1. Should you bother contributing to an open source project if it hasn't been updated for a while? Or is that a potential waste of time?
2. Are there any security risks with open source projects?
3. Are issues only for bugs vs pull requests being for actual contributions?
